# MADHAV-E-COMMERCE-SALES-DASHBOARD

•Project Title/Headline

Madhav E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

•Short Description/Purpose

The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview and performance analysis of e-commerce sales for "Madhav." Its purpose is to track key metrics such as total sales amount, quantity sold, and profit, while also breaking down performance by geography (state), product category, payment mode, sub-category, and month. This allows stakeholders to quickly understand sales trends and profitability.

•Tech Stack

Based on the visual style, interactive elements, and common business practices for creating such dashboards, the likely primary tool is:
 * Microsoft Power BI (Most likely, given the aesthetic)

Note: The exact tech stack (e.g., specific database, cloud services) cannot be determined from the screenshot alone, but a Business Intelligence (BI) tool like Power BI is the front-end visualization technology.

•Data Source

The data source is a Transactional E-commerce Sales Dataset, which would contain records of individual sales transactions. This data would include fields such as:
 * Transaction Amount
 * Quantity
 * Profit
 * Product Category/Sub-Category
 * State
 * Customer Name
 * Payment Mode
 * Date of Sale (for monthly analysis)
Note: The source is an internal e-commerce database, not a public or external one.
•Features / Highlights

The dashboard features several key visualization types, including:
 * KPI Cards: Displaying aggregated key performance indicators (KPIs) like Sum of Amount (438K), Sum of Quantity (5615), Sum of Profit (37K).
 * Bar Charts: Showing breakdowns like Sum of Amount by State (e.g., Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh), and Sum of Amount by CustomerName (e.g., Harikansh, Madhav Mohan).
 * Line/Column Chart (Combo Chart): Tracking Profit by Month to show seasonality and performance over time, including negative profit months (losses).
 * Donut/Pie Charts: Showing proportions for Sum of Quantity by Category (e.g., Clothing 63%, Electronics 21%, Furniture 17%) and Sum of Quantity by PaymentMode (e.g., COD 44%, UPI 21%, Credit Card 12%).
 * Horizontal Bar Chart: Highlighting Sum of Profit by Sub-Category (e.g., Printers, Bookcases, Saree) for granular profitability insights.
 * Filter/Slicer: A global filter for Quarter (Qtr 1, Qtr 2, Qtr 3, Qtr 4) and an 'All' selection for overall view.
 •Business Impact and Insights

The dashboard provides several actionable business insights:
 * Profitability Concerns: The "Profit by Month" chart clearly shows significant losses (negative profit) during the middle of the year (May, June, July, August, September), indicating a major seasonal or operational issue that needs investigation.
 * Category Performance: Clothing is the dominant category by quantity sold (63%), suggesting a strong focus or high demand in this area.
 * Geographic Focus: Maharashtra is the leading state in terms of sales amount, making it a critical market for investment and focus.
* Payment Preference: COD (Cash on Delivery) is the most preferred payment mode (44%), which has implications for cash flow and logistics.
 * Sub-Category Profit: Printers and Bookcases are the most profitable sub-categories, while Tables and Totables appear to be the least profitable (or incurring losses, based on the red coloring).
 * High-Value Customers: Harikansh is the top customer by sales amount, suggesting potential for a targeted customer retention program.
